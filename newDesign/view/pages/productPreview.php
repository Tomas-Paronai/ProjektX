    <div class="description-text">
        As one of driving forces behind the Blu-ray format, Sony may have produced more Blu-ray players than anyone else.
        Every year we see many new models from them as high-end features trickle down the line, and new features appear.
        This trickle-down effect leads to every player being a better value than the year before, and to the higher-end players becoming even more niche products.
